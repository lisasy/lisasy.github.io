I'm an interdisciplinary digital designer, illustrator, and artist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Having worked with many people I've admired at <a href="https://facebook.design/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, I am now an independent freelance designer and illustrator. I bring 7 years of professional experience from leading design in content moderation and reporting at Facebook, to working with engineers and clients on shipping production-ready code for numerous startups and enterprises, to collaborating with good, curious folks working on compelling projects and initiatives. If you think we can work well together, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:lisasyis@gmail.com">lisasyis@gmail.com</a>. </p> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4di8zdq1viki8qa/lisa_sy_resume_2018.pdf?dl=0" target=_blank class=button_primary> <p class=button_title>View Resume</p> </a> </div> <div class=col_secondary> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/about/about-aff2b85b.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="about_section_container highlight"> <section class=design_approach_content> <h5 class="header_title header_title_h3">My Design Approach</h5> <p class=header_content> Product and UX design doesn't start and end at the edges of pixelated screen. Whether I'm building new apps and services, or optimizing existing ones, I bridge the needs and opportunities between businesses/organizations and people. When I'm solving such business and user problems, I uphold these approaches and values: </p> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 01 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Bold Visioning, Bold Listening </h4> <p class=list_content_description> I want to hear you speak about your vision and your goals. Period. </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 02 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Scaled Strategy </h4> <p class=list_content_description> The best approaches execute well not only in the short term, but also envision a path forward. Not only do I guide my design practice around the immediate requirements, resources, and goals, but also towards the larger vision. </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 03 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Intentional Process </h4> <p class=list_content_description> Let me tell you something: I don't like wasting other peoples' time, nor my own. That's why each step of my work process is intentional, deliberate, and thoughtful. From meetings to stages of the design sprint, I make sure that each process will deliver certain outcomes that we've prioritized. If not, then why do them? </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 04 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Creative Collaboration </h4> <p class=list_content_description> It may seem unlikely, but some of the best ideas emerge when you're around people of different backgrounds who are yet comfortable enough to share their perspectives and experiences with each other. I enjoy inspiring such an environment with my team, whether I'm leading a UX session to generate new product concepts, or in a 1:1 conversation with a peer. </p> </div> </article> </section> </div> <div class="about_section_container secondary"> <div class=col_primary> <h5 class=header_title_h3>Other</h5> <p> Outside of my professional design practice, I engage in personal and community projects. I maintain a visual arts practice, run an independent webcomic Plurals and Noun, curate art and literary events with local Bay Area artists, and volunteer with my local community. </p> <p> Since early 2017, I’ve been a board member of <a href="http://oaklanddigital.org/" target=_blank>Oakland Digital</a>, a non-profit in Oakland focused on empowering early-career creative professionals with relevant skills and practice. </p> <p> As a first-generation college graduate in my family, I graduated from <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/amst/" target=_blank>Wesleyan University with a B.A. in American Studies</a> with an emphasis on Race and Ethnic Studies. There is no way for me to discredit the value of my <a href="https://medium.com/@lisasy/how-i-went-from-liberal-arts-to-tech-4d32f78f30d6" target=_blank> liberal arts education emphasizing the development of foundational, interdisciplinary skills</a>, such as writing, critical-thinking, collaboration, and reading. As a student, I founded and managed the premier student-run design agency called TypeClub. I was the only woman and non-engineer at Wesleyan's first hackathon in 2013. Since graduating, I've continued to mentor current and recent graduates to pursue careers in design and the technology sector. </p> <p> Lastly, I love learning new languages and exposing myself to different kinds of people, environment, and cultures! I speak English, French, Cantonese, and Mandarin Chinese to varying degrees of proficiency, and I'm currently learning Spanish. </p> </div> <div class="col_secondary featured"> <h5 class=header_title_h3>Featured</h5> <section class=button_stack> <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details/45158" class=button_stack_li> <h6 class=li_source>August 24, 2016 · Podcast</h6> <h5 class=li_title>Design Details #159 Twe-Mail</h5> </a> <a href="https://techiesproject.com/lisa-sy/" class=button_stack_li> <h6 class=li_source>March 5, 2016 · Interview</h6> <h5 class=li_title>The Techies Project</h5> </a> <a href="https://techiesproject.com/lisa-sy/" class=button_stack_li> <h6 class=li_source>January 17, 2016 · Television Interview</h6> <h5 class=li_title>Oakland Digital on NBC Bay Area</h5> </a> </section> </div> </div> </section> </main> <footer class=site_footer> <div class=site_footer_container> <section class=site_footer_container_wrapper> <div class=col_primary> <p> This <a href="http://github.com/lisasy/lisasy.github.io" target=_blank>site</a> was made using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/" target=_blank>Middleman</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target=_blank>Netlify</a>.

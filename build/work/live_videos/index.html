I conceived, coordinated, designed, executed, and ship a product resulting in higher report volumes of objectionable content that our Community Operations organization was able to remove. This enables Facebook to become a safer platform for people to be their authentic selves. </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section no_margin col_full_stretch"> <div class=col> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/project_overview-1ca6d213.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h5 class=work_section_title> Objective </h5> <h2> Empower people to report live videos showing offensive or flagrant content, such as graphic violence, hate speech, nudity and pornography, spam, and more. </h2> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h5 class=work_section_title> Background </h5> <p> Up until this project, I had been investigating how to improve Facebook&rsquo;s existing reporting flow so that people can better flag objectionable content anywhere from Facebook. The existing reporting flow wasn&rsquo;t efficient nor ideal in meeting users&rsquo; needs. Furthermore, it was built on a legacy code base constrained making meaningful iterative design and engineering changes. Furthermore, it was a product that many cross-functional teams had much stake and voice in, such as the Policy, Communications, and Community Operations teams. </p> <p> Through ample user research, our team highlighted that these were the core needs and expectations that people have been they encounter a problem on Facebook. Our responsiblity was to meet people where they are at. </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_mid_stretch align_center mg_dw_m"> <div class=col> <div class=list_container_col> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 01 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Discover </h4> <p class=list_content_description> People know where and how to report content on Facebook. </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 02 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Express </h4> <p class=list_content_description> People can express and articulate what their issue is. </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 03 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Take Action </h4> <p class=list_content_description> People know that they can take action to resolve their problem. </p> </div> </article> <article class=list_item> <div class=list_counter> <h5 class=list_counter_value> 04 </h5> </div> <div class=list_content> <h4 class=list_content_title> Confirmation </h4> <p class=list_content_description> People know that their issue is being taken care of. </p> </div> </article> </div> </div> </div> <div class="work_section no_margin highlight col_full_stretch"> <div class=col> <div class="ctr col_ctr"> <h2> What was wrong with the existing reporting flow? </h2> <p> The legacy reporting system was filled with many UX and UI problems that made it challenging for people to discover, express their problem, and see the help they needed. </p> </div> <hr> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/existing_flow-7a3bf25e.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h2> The opportunity </h2> <p> When Mark Zuckerberg announced internally that the company would focus deeply on Live Videos for a month-long sprint, my team joined its efforts. Rather than adapt the existing reporting flow to Live Videos, we built a new one from scratch. I worked rapidly across multiple time zones with stakeholders in Product, Policy, and Community Operations to understand our requirements, unblock constraints and unknowns, and drive alignment to ship an improved reporting flow. This new reporting flow made it easier for people to discover, express their problem, and find the help that they need from Facebook. </p> <p> Improvements in the new reporting flow introduced new principles to bring into our reporting system overall: </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section no_margin highlight col_mid_stretch mg_dw_m"> <div class="col fl fl_ai_ctr"> <div class="col_2of3 pd_rt_s"> <h2> Richer Expression </h2> <p> <strong> How might we help people better express their issues on our platform? </strong> The new reporting form relies on tags and open-textfield for user input. This made it possible for people to select multiple tags, allowing fuller expression of their problem. They could also now describe their issues in in their own words. </p> </div> <div class=col_1of3> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/expression-dbb0ffd8.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="col fl fl_ai_ctr"> <div class=col_1of3> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/ssi-c3a2fe4b.png"/> </figure> </div> <div class="col_2of3 pd_lf_s"> <h2> Dynamic and Personalized </h2> <p> <strong> How might we better affirm we&rsquo;re listening to your issues? </strong> Amidst the wide range of issues that people can select, we recognize that suicide and self-injury are immediate emergencies require instant aid. That&rsquo;s why we ask people to contact their law enforcements, who are most equipped to handle the situation in real-time. </p> </div> </div> <hr> <div class="col fl fl_ai_ctr"> <div class="col_2of3 pd_rt_s"> <h2> Clearer Confirmation </h2> <p> <strong> How might we give people clear expectations of what&rsquo;s next? </strong> Whereas the previous reporting flow did not give people confidence that they submitted a report, this one clarifies it better through iconography, typographic hierarchy, and content. </p> </div> <div class=col_1of3> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/confirmation-3fbd4514.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h2> Outcomes </h2> <p> The Live Video reporting flow was more effective in flagging flagrant content than the existing reporting flow. When we A/B launched the two flows, we found that the new reporting flow captured: </p> <p> <ul class=styled> <li> 1.5x more policy-violating Live broadcasts. </li> <li> 7.5x more distinct people reporting Live broadcasts. </li> <li> 5.75x more distinct Live broadcasts reviewable by our Community Operations team. </li> </ul> </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section no_margin col_full_stretch"> <div class=col> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/project_overview-1ca6d213.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <p><hr></p> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h2> Recap </h2> <p class=special_paragraph> This project was exciting and allowed our team to move fast with the validation we had already heard from our data and user research.

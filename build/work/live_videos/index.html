I conceived, coordinated, designed, executed, and ship the product so that people can report objectionable, sensitive content that may arise from live video content. </p> <p> Compared to the existing reporting flow, this new one resulted in more reportings, allowing Facebook was able to receive and take action on. This enables Facebook to become a safer platform for people to be their authentic selves. </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section no_margin col_full_stretch"> <div class=col> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/work/fb_reporting_live_videos/project_overview-071b779c.png"/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h5 class=work_section_title> Objective </h5> <h2> Empower people to report live videos showing offensive or flagrant content, such as graphic violence, hate speech, nudity and pornography, spam, and more. </h2> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h5 class=work_section_title> Background </h5> <p> Up until this project, I had been investigating how to improve Facebook&rsquo;s existing reporting flow so that people can better flag objectionable content anywhere from Facebook. Our team was dealing with a legacy product that engineers found hard to make small changes in, and that other cross-functional teams had much stake and voice in, such as the Policy, Communications, and Community Operations teams. </p> <p> Given the cross-functional considerations and the technical limitations under which we iterated, I had been running incremental experiments to validate how people can discover, understand, communicate their problem, and receive a helpful response from Facebook. This month-long sprint allowed our team to place our big bet in this vision, bypassing our past technical limitations as we built a new reporting flow from scratch. </p> </div> </div> <p><hr></p> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h2> In a nutshell, I: </h2> <p> <ul class=styled> <li> Drove end-to-end design and development across multiple internal organizations (Product, Policy, Communications, Community Operations) with colleagues in Menlo Park, Seattle, and London. </li> <li> Coordinated agilely with core Live Videos team to develop a consistent product experience in tandem with each other. </li> <li> Developed an extensible product framework applicable to varying severity of reporting use cases, ranging from most &ldquo;minor&rdquo; (nudity or sex acts) to most critical (suicide and self-injury). </li> </ul> </p> </div> </div> <div class="work_section col_full"> <div class=col> <h2> Outcomes </h2> <p> The Live Video reporting flow was more effective in flagging flagrant content than the existing reporting flow. When we A/B launched the two flows, we found that the new reporting flow captured: </p> <p> <ul class=styled> <li> 1.5x more policy-violating Live broadcasts. </li> <li> 7.5x more distinct people reporting Live broadcasts. </li> <li> 5.75x more distinct Live broadcasts reviewable by our Community Operations team. </li> </ul> </p> </div> </div> </article> </div> </section> </main> <footer class=site_footer> <div class=site_footer_container> <section class=site_footer_container_wrapper> <div class=col_primary> <p> This <a href="http://github.com/lisasy/lisasy.github.io" target=_blank>site</a> was made using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/" target=_blank>Middleman</a> and is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target=_blank>Netlify</a>.

      When Facebook went on a month-long "lockdown" in early 2016 to ship Live
      Videos on its platform, I oversaw the product design and direction of its
      reporting flow. I conceived, coordinated, designed, executed, and ship
      the product so that people can report objectionable, sensitive content
      that may arise from live video content.

      Objective
    </h5>
    <h2>
      Empower people to report live videos showing offensive or flagrant
      content, such as graphic violence, hate speech, nudity and pornography,
      spam, and more.

      Background
    </h5>
    <p>
      Up until this project, I had been investigating how to improve Facebook's existing reporting flow so that people can better flag objectionable content anywhere from Facebook. Our team was dealing with a legacy product that engineers found hard to make small changes in, and that other cross-functional teams had much stake and voice in, such as the Policy, Communications, and Community Operations teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the cross-functional considerations and the technical limitations under which we iterated, I had been running incremental experiments to validate how people can discover, understand, communicate their problem, and receive a helpful response from Facebook. This month-long sprint allowed our team to place our big bet in this vision, bypassing our past technical limitations as we built a new reporting flow from scratch.

      In a nutshell, I:
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul class="styled">
        <li>
          Drove end-to-end design and development across multiple internal
          organizations (Product, Policy, Communications, Community Operations)
           with colleagues in Menlo Park, Seattle, and London.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinated agilely with core Live Videos team to develop a
          consistent product experience in tandem with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed an extensible product framework applicable to varying
          severity of reporting use cases, ranging from most "minor" (nudity or
          sex acts) to most critical (suicide and self-injury).

      Outcomes
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Live Video reporting flow was more effective in flagging flagrant
      content than the existing reporting flow. When we A/B launched the two
      flows, we found that the new reporting flow captured:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul class="styled">
        <li>
          1.5x more policy-violating Live broadcasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          7.5x more distinct people reporting Live
          broadcasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          5.75x more distinct Live broadcasts reviewable by our Community
          Operations team.
        </li>
      </ul>

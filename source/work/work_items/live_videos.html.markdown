      When Facebook went on a month-long "lockdown" in early 2016 to ship
      Live Videos on its platform, I oversaw the product design and
      direction of a new reporting flow empowering people to report
      objectionable, sensitive content from Live Videos. I conceived,
      coordinated, designed, executed, and ship a product resulting in
      higher report volumes of objectionable content that our Community
      Operations organization was able to remove.  This enables Facebook to
      become a safer platform for people to be their authentic selves.

      Empower people to report live videos showing offensive or flagrant

      Background
    </h5>
    <p>
      Up until this project, I had been investigating how to improve Facebook's
      existing reporting flow so that people can better flag objectionable
      content anywhere from Facebook. The existing reporting flow wasn't
      efficient nor ideal in meeting users' needs. Furthermore, it was built
      on a legacy code base constrained making meaningful iterative design and engineering changes.
      Furthermore, it was a product that many cross-functional teams had much
      stake and voice in, such as the Policy, Communications, and Community
      Operations teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through ample user research, our team highlighted that these were the
      core needs and expectations that people have been they encounter a
      problem on Facebook. Our responsiblity was to meet people where they are
      at.

        What was wrong with the existing reporting flow?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The legacy reporting system was filled with many UX and UI problems
        that made it challenging for people to discover, express their problem,
        and see the help they needed.

      The opportunity
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mark Zuckerberg announced internally that the company would focus
      deeply on Live Videos for a month-long sprint, my team joined its
      efforts. Rather than adapt the existing reporting flow to Live Videos, we
      built a new one from scratch. I worked rapidly across multiple time zones
      with stakeholders in Product, Policy, and Community Operations to
      understand our requirements, unblock constraints and unknowns, and drive
      alignment to ship an improved reporting flow. This new reporting flow made
      it easier for people to discover, express their problem, and find the
      help that they need from Facebook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improvements in the new reporting flow introduced new principles to bring
      into our reporting system overall:

        <strong>
          How might we help people better express their issues on our
          platform?
        </strong>
        The new reporting form relies on tags and open-textfield for user
        input. This made it possible for people to select multiple tags,
        allowing fuller expression of their problem. They could also now
        describe their issues in in their own words.

        Amidst the wide range of issues that people can select, we recognize

        Whereas the previous reporting flow did not give people confidence that

        iconography, typographic hierarchy, and content.

      Outcomes
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Live Video reporting flow was more effective in flagging flagrant
      content than the existing reporting flow. When we A/B launched the two
      flows, we found that the new reporting flow captured:
    </p>

      <ul class="styled">
        <li>
          1.5x more policy-violating Live broadcasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          7.5x more distinct people reporting Live
          broadcasts.
        </li>
        <li>
          5.75x more distinct Live broadcasts reviewable by our Community
          Operations team.

      This project was exciting and allowed our team to move fast with the validation we had already heard from our data and user research. I approached the project with these principles in mind:

            Collaboration

          Drove end-to-end design and development across multiple internal
          organizations (Product, Policy, Communications, Community Operations)
           with colleagues in Menlo Park, Seattle, and London.

          Coordinated agilely with core Live Videos team to develop a

            Extensibility
          </strong>
          <br>
          Developed an extensible product framework applicable to varying
          severity of reporting use cases, ranging from most "minor" (nudity or
          sex acts) to most critical (suicide and self-injury).

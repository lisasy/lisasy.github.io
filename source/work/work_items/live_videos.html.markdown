      In early 2016, Facebook shifted its focus to build and ship Live Videos
      on its platform; I oversaw the product design to conceive, coordinate,
      design, and execute and shipping its reporting flow so that people can
      report objectionable, sensitive content that may arise from live video
      content.

          Developed product platform and framework to extend potential vertical
          reporting use cases, ranging from most "minor" (nudity or sex acts)
          to most critical (suicide and self-injury).

      Results
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Live Video reporting flow was more effective in flagging flagrant
      content than the existing reporting flow.
